## Word Bank database with `wbstats`

The [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) contains a rich and detailed set of socioeconomic indicators spanning several decades and dozens of topics. Their data is available for bulk download as CSV files from their [website](https://data.worldbank.org/). You previously practiced importing this data for all countries (see HW5). However, frequently you only need to obtain a handful of indicators or a subset of countries.

To provide more granular access to this information, the World Bank provides a [RESTful API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589) for querying and obtaining a portion of their database programmatically. 

The [`wbstats`](http://nset-ornl.github.io/wbstats/) provides a wrapper for R to allow for relatively easy access to the API and return the results in a tidy data frame.

```{r}
library(wbstats)
library(tidyverse)
```


### Finding available data with `wb_cachelist`

`wb_cachelist` contains a snapshot of available countries, indicators, and other relevant information obtainable through the WB API:

```{r wb-cachelist}
str(wb_cachelist, max.level = 1)
glimpse(wb_cachelist$countries)
```


### Search available data with `wb_search()`

`wb_search()` searches through the `wb_cachelist$indicators` data frame to find indicators that match the search pattern. Alternatively, you can use the [web interface](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) to determine specific indicators and their IDs:

```{r wb-search}
wb_search("unemployment")
wb_search("labor force")
```

```{r wb-search-limit}
# limit search to just the indicator name
wb_search("labor force", fields = "indicator")
```


### Downloading data with `wb_data()`

Once you have the set of indicators you would like to obtain, you can use the `wb_data()` function to generate the API query and download the results. 

For example, if we want to obtain information on [the percent of females participating in the labor force](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS?view=chart). The indicator ID is `SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS`. We can download the indicator for all countries from 1990-2020 using:

```{r female-labor}
female_labor <- wb_data(
  indicator = "SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS",
  start_date = 1990,
  end_date = 2020
)
female_labor
```

Note the column containing our indicator uses the indicator ID as its name. This is hard to read, so we can adjust it directly in the function:

```{r female-labor-clean}
female_labor <- wb_data(
  indicator = c("fem_lab_part" = "SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS"),
  start_date = 1990,
  end_date = 2020
)
female_labor
```

NB: **do not run the same APIs query code multiple times!** Run it once, and when you have collected your data, save them in a csv, and import them back (vs. interactively download them every time you run the script). Set your chunk options as `cache = TRUE` https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cache.html

Once the data are obtained, we can analyze them, for example:

```{r female-labor-plot, dependson = "female-labor-clean", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = female_labor, mapping = aes(x = date, y = fem_lab_part)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(group = country), alpha = .1) +
  geom_smooth() +
  # documentation https://rdrr.io/cran/scales/man/percent_format.html
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Labor force participation",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Percent of total labor force which is female",
    caption = "Source: World Bank"
  )
```

By default, `wb_data()` returns queries as data frames in a wide format. So if we request multiple indicators, each indicator will be stored in its own column:

```{r female-educ, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
female_vars <- wb_data(
  indicator = c(
    "fem_lab_part" = "SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS",
    "fem_educ_sec" = "SE.SEC.CUAT.UP.FE.ZS"
  ),
  start_date = 1990,
  end_date = 2020
)

ggplot(data = female_vars, mapping = aes(x = fem_educ_sec, y = fem_lab_part)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Female labor force participation",
    x = "Percent of females 25+ who completed secondary school",
    y = "Percent of total labor force which is female",
    caption = "Source: World Bank"
  )
```
